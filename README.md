Description

It is a one stop platform for like-minded users and local vendors to connect. The vendors are able to market their product online. The users will be able to browse and buy products in their area from vendors that can sell at a reduced overhead cost by removing the entry and time constraints involved in participation at a physical farmers market


### Key Features

- Vendors can register and create their account.
- Vendors can add, update and delete their profile which contains three main things
    - An about section that has information about the vendor
    - A product section that showcases all the products that the vendor has to offer along with images
    - A bulletin board section that displays special updates and news
- Customers can view all the vendors in their area by inputting a zipcode


## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

- React is great choice for building interactive and dynamic UIs. It is component based which is perfect for an      application like Market Avenue which has a nested component structure.            

#### Sass/SCSS

- It allows us to create variables, mixins and functions which makes it easy to reuse styles across the app. It      allows us to write nested CSS which is easy to write and understand

#### Cloudinary React

-    

#### Axios

-  


#### Front end deployed to `üö´insert service here`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/quick-street-be) built using:

#### Express

- made it fast and easy to set up
- allowed us to create Restful API
- made it easy to connect to mongooseDB
- made it easy to incorporate middleware

#### MongoDB

# APIs

## Authentication API here

The API allows users to register and login to Market Avenue. There are two user types - vendors and customers.

## Google Maps JavaScript API 

We are using the Google Maps JavaScript API to display a map to the users which points out the area in which a vendor works. 

## Google Geocoding API

We are using the Google Geocoding API to convert a zipcode into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), to position the map.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.


# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file at the root level containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY - This is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
